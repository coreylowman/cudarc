//! This file outlines a typical build process which can be used for more complex CUDA projects utilising this crate.
//! It does the following:
//!     1. Use a `build.rs` file to compile your CUDA code/project into a PTX file. Your CUDA code/project can be as complicated as you need them to be, including multiple files, with headers for your struct definitions, each kernel in it's own file, etc.
//!     2. The build process compiles the kernels into a PTX file, which is written to the output directory
//!     3. The build process then uses the `bindgen` crate to generate Rust bindings for the structs defined in your CUDA code
//!     4. In the `main.rs` code, the PTX code is included as a string via the `!include_str` macro, which is then compiled using the functions in this crate (detailed in previous examples)
//!
//! The advantages of having this build process for more complex CUDA projects:
//!     - You only need to define your structs once, in your CUDA code, and the Rust bindings are generated automatically
//!     - You have full intellisense for your CUDA code since they can be stored under a separate folder or even as part of a separate project
//!
//! There are two files in this example: `main.rs` and `build.rs`. You can reference them and add to your project accordingly. The `cuda` folder in this example gives a simple example of defining structs in a separate header, including creating a `wrapper.h` header for `bindgen`
